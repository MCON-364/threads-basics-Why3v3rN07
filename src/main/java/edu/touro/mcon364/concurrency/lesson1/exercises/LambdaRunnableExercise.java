/**
 * Exercise 5: Creating threads with a Runnable passed as a lambda
 *
 * The lesson showed four equivalent ways to write a Runnable.
 * This exercise practises the lambda style — the most common modern form:
 *
 *   Runnable r = () -> { ... };
 *   Thread t = new Thread(r, "thread-name");
 *   t.start();
 *
 * Or inline:
 *   Thread t = new Thread(() -> { ... }, "thread-name");
 *
 * Your tasks:
 *
 * (A) launchLoggerThread(List<String> log, String message)
 *     Create a Runnable AS A LAMBDA that appends {@code message} to {@code log},
 *     wrap it in a Thread named "logger", start it, and join it before returning.
 *
 * (B) launchTwoCounterThreads(List<Task> tasks, List<String> threadNames)
 *     Launch exactly two threads using INLINE lambda syntax:
 *       - "counter-a" iterates through tasks and counts those with Priority.HIGH,
 *         storing the result in highCount.
 *       - "counter-b" iterates through tasks and counts those with Priority.LOW,
 *         storing the result in lowCount.
 *     Start both threads, then join both before returning.
 *
 * Do NOT use an anonymous class or a named class — lambdas only.
